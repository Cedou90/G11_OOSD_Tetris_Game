/**
 * BoardUtils provides centralized Tetris game logic utilities.
 * 
 * This class eliminates code duplication by providing static methods for common
 * board operations that are needed by both the main game logic and AI simulation.
 * 
 * All methods work on raw int[][] board arrays for maximum flexibility and performance.
 * Board format: 0 = empty cell, positive integers = filled cells (piece color IDs)
 * 
 * Design principles:
 * - Pure functions: No side effects except on passed arrays
 * - Static methods: No state, just utilities
 * - Performance focused: Optimized for frequent AI simulation use
 * - Single source of truth: One implementation of each game rule
